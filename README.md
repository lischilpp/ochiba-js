OchibaJS is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify the animation of child elements, making it easy to bring your web content to life. The library is built with simplicity in mind, featuring a minimal file size and no external dependencies.

### Key Features

- **Text Splitting:** If your element contains text, OchibaJS can automatically split it into individual spans, allowing each letter or word to be animated independently.

- **Flexible Animation Control:** You can easily control various animation properties such as duration, delay, and easing, enabling the creation of complex animations with just a few lines of code.

- **CSS Export:** The entire animation can be exported as CSS code, allowing you to use it without relying on JavaScript or including the OchibaJS library in your project.

    duration: 1,
    order: 'asc',
    timing: 'linear',
    leafAnimation: {
        duration: 1,
